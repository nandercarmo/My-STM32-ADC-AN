# My-STM32-ADC-AN
This project is a simple example demonstrating the behavior of the ADC peripheral of the STM32 NUCLEO-G474RE kit, as described in the Application Note available in the 'doc' directory of this repository.  All the behavior of the project is described (in Portuguese) in the document AN_G474RE_ADC_Application_Note.pdf. However, in a simplified way, the ADC was configured to collect voltage values ​​from a potentiometer in continuous conversion operation mode, for a single channel and using DMA, and transmit these values ​​through the serial to a PC in order to visualize the values collected.
